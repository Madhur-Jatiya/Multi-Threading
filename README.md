# Multithreading

In this repository, I have created a set of classes that are designed to teach the basic fundamentals of multithreading. These classes cover various aspects of multithreading, including different thread methods such as demon, interrupt, join, priority, sleep, and yield. Additionally, I have included examples of basic multithreading projects like a digital clock and ticket booking system.

The classes in this repository are designed to be easy to understand, with clear explanations of each concept and plenty of code examples. By working through these classes, users can gain a strong foundation in multithreading and learn how to apply these concepts to their own projects.

The digital clock example demonstrates how to create a clock using multithreading, with one thread handling the clock display and another thread handling the clock timer. The ticket booking system example shows how multithreading can be used to create a more efficient and responsive ticket booking system, with multiple threads handling different parts of the booking process.

Overall, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn about multithreading or to improve their understanding of this important programming concept. The classes and examples included here are clear, concise, and easy to follow, making them an excellent tool for both beginners and more experienced developers alike.
